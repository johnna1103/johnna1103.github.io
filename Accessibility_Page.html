        The accessibility features that I included was a

    <ul>

        <li>Working and focusable event calender that goes week by week for the month. I just have it doing three weeks but it would be relatively easy to add the next weeks event to the JSON file. It also reads to the screen reader easily and I hope it makes sense. If I have more time I would have probably done an actual date with it instead of just saying week one or week two.

        </li>
        <li>I have the weather system where it tells the updated forecast with a visual icon on the side of it.
        </li>
        <li>I also included a bypass block at the beginning of the page and it skips to the search bar.
        </li>
        <li>Everything necessary for the continuity of the webpage is tabbed accessible
        </li>
