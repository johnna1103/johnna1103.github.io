	<p>There is a bypass block at the beginning of the page that allows a user to skip all navigation and start with the main content.</p>
	<p>All neccessary content items are tabbable and read to a screen reader.</p>
	<p>All neccessary content is focused when tabbed on which was one of the bigger problems with the original website</p>
